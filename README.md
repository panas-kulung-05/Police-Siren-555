# Police-Siren-555

🚨 Police Siren & LED Flasher using 555 Timer IC
📌 Overview

This project demonstrates how the popular 555 Timer IC can be used to build a police siren sound generator along with a police-style LED flasher circuit.
The project is ideal for beginners in electronics to understand timing circuits, oscillators, and basic sound & light generation techniques.

Both circuits are simple, low-cost, and can be built using commonly available components.
